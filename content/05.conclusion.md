## Conclusions

We demonstrated that genome-wide UV repair profiles between human and and mouse lemur are strongly correlated.
Our results shed light onto deep homologies of same tissue types in primates by suggesting similar epigenetic architecture between them.
We believe our results on varying repair rates between the two species will guide follow-up studies investigating the evolutionary effects of day time activity and UV avoidance on differential nucleotide excision repair rates.
