    "abstract": "Recurrent mutations are frequently associated with transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBS) in melanoma, but the mechanism driving mutagenesis at TFBS is unclear. Here, we use a method called CPD-seq to map the distribution of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) across the human genome at single nucleotide resolution. Our results indicate that CPD lesions are elevated at active TFBS, an effect that is primarily due to E26 transformation-specific (ETS) TFs. We show that ETS TFs induce a unique signature of CPD hotspots that are highly correlated with recurrent mutations in melanomas, despite high repair activity at these sites. ETS1 protein renders its DNA binding targets extremely susceptible to UV damage in vitro, due to binding-induced perturbations in the DNA structure that favor CPD formation. These findings define a mechanism responsible for recurrent mutations in melanoma and reveal that DNA binding by ETS TFs is inherently mutagenic in UV-exposed cells.",

    "abstract": "We recently developed a high-resolution genome-wide assay for mapping DNA excision repair named eXcision Repair-sequencing (XR-seq) and have now used XR-seq to determine which regions of the genome are subject to repair very soon after UV exposure and which regions are repaired later. Over a time course, we measured repair of the UV-induced damage of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) (at 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h) and (6-4)pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs] (at 5 and 20 min and 1, 2, and 4 h) in normal human skin fibroblasts. Each type of damage has distinct repair kinetics. The (6-4)PPs are detected as early as 5 min after UV treatment, with the bulk of repair completed by 4 h. Repair of CPDs, which we previously showed is intimately coupled to transcription, is slower and in certain regions persists even 2 d after UV irradiation. We compared our results to the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements data regarding histone modifications, chromatin state, and transcription. For both damage types, and for both transcription-coupled and general excision repair, the earliest repair occurred preferentially in active and open chromatin states. Conversely, repair in regions classified as “heterochromatic” and “repressed” was relatively low at early time points, with repair persisting into the late time points. Damage that remains during DNA replication increases the risk for mutagenesis. Indeed, late-repaired regions are associated with a higher level of cancer-linked mutations. In summary, we show that XR-seq is a powerful approach for studying relationships among chromatin state, DNA repair, genome stability, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin is a major anticancer drug that kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Cancer cells cope with the drug by removal of the damages with nucleotide excision repair. We have developed methods to measure cisplatin adduct formation and its repair at single-nucleotide resolution. “Damage-seq” relies on the replication-blocking properties of the bulky base lesions to precisely map their location. “XR-seq” independently maps the removal of these damages by capturing and sequencing the excised oligomer released during repair. The damage and repair maps we generated reveal that damage distribution is essentially uniform and is dictated mostly by the underlying sequence. In contrast, cisplatin repair is heterogeneous in the genome and is affected by multiple factors including transcription and chromatin states. Thus, the overall effect of damages in the genome is primarily driven not by damage formation but by the repair efficiency. The combination of the Damage-seq and XR-seq methods has the potential for developing novel cancer therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "We used high-throughput sequencing of short, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-containing ssDNA oligos generated during repair of UV-induced damage to study that process at both mechanistic and systemic levels in . Numerous important insights on DNA repair were obtained, bringing clarity to the respective roles of UvrD helicase and Mfd translocase in repair of UV-induced damage. Mechanistically, experiments showed that the predominant role of UvrD in vivo is to unwind the excised 13-mer from dsDNA and that mutation of results in remarkable protection of that oligo from exonuclease activity as it remains hybridized to the dsDNA. Genome-wide analysis of the transcribed strand/nontranscribed strand (TS/NTS) repair ratio demonstrated that deletion of globally shifts the distribution of TS/NTS ratios downward by a factor of about 2 on average for the most highly transcribed genes. Even for the least transcribed genes, Mfd played a role in preferential repair of the transcribed strand. On the other hand, mutation of , if anything, slightly pushed the distribution of TS/NTS ratios to higher ratios. These results indicate that Mfd is the transcription repair-coupling factor whereas UvrD plays a role in excision repair by aiding the catalytic turnover of excision repair proteins.",

We find that these photoproducts are removed from the genome primarily by incisions 13–18 nucleotides 5′ and 6–7 nucleotides 3′ to the UV damage that generate 21- to 27-nt-long excision products. Analyses of the excision repair kinetics both in single genes and at the genome-wide level reveal strong transcription-coupled repair of the transcribed strand at early time points followed by predominantly nontranscribed strand repair at later stages. We have also characterized the excision repair level as a function of the transcription level. The availability of high-resolution and dynamic repair maps should aid in future repair and mutagenesis studies in this model organism.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin is a major cancer chemotherapeutic drug. It kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA, mainly in the form of Pt-d(GpG) diadducts. However, it also has serious side effects, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity that limit its usefulness. Chronotherapy is taking circadian time into account during therapy to improve the therapeutic index, by improving efficacy and/or limiting toxicity. To this end, we tested the impact of clock time on excision repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage at single-nucleotide resolution across the genome in mouse kidney and liver. We found that genome repair is controlled by two circadian programs. Repair of the transcribed strand (TS) of active, circadian-controlled genes is dictated by each gene’s phase of transcription, which falls across the circadian cycle with prominent peaks at dawn and dusk. In contrast, repair of the nontranscribed strand (NTS) of all genes, repair of intergenic DNA, and global repair overall peaks at Zeitgeber time ZT08, as basal repair capacity, which is controlled by the circadian clock, peaks at this circadian time. Consequently, the TS and NTS of many genes are repaired out of phase. As most cancers are thought to have defective circadian rhythms, these results suggest that future research on timed dosage of cisplatin could potentially reduce damage to healthy tissue and improve its therapeutic index.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of replicon initiation is a stereotypic DNA damage response mediated through S checkpoint mechanisms not yet fully understood. Studies were undertaken to elucidate the function of checkpoint proteins in the inhibition of replicon initiation following irradiation with 254 nm UV light (UVC) of diploid human fibroblasts immortalized by the ectopic expression of telomerase. Velocity sedimentation analysis of nascent DNA molecules revealed a 50% inhibition of replicon initiation when normal human fibroblasts were treated with a low dose of UVC (1 J/m ). Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and AT-like disorder fibroblasts, which lack an S checkpoint response when exposed to ionizing radiation, responded normally when exposed to UVC and inhibited replicon initiation. Pretreatment of normal and AT fibroblasts with caffeine or UCN-01, inhibitors of ATR (AT mutated and Rad3 related) and Chk1, respectively, abolished the S checkpoint response to UVC. Moreover, overexpression of kinase-inactive ATR in U2OS cells severely attenuated UVC-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and reversed the UVC-induced inhibition of replicon initiation, as did overexpression of kinase-inactive Chk1. Taken together, these data suggest that the UVC-induced S checkpoint response of inhibition of replicon initiation is mediated by ATR signaling through Chk-1 and is independent of ATM, Nbs1, and Mre11.",

    "abstract": "Systematic genetic studies of a handful of diverse organisms over the past 50 years have transformed our understanding of biology. However, many aspects of primate biology, behavior, and disease are absent or poorly modeled in any of the current genetic model organisms including mice. We surveyed the animal kingdom to find other animals with advantages similar to mice that might better exemplify primate biology, and identified mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) as the outstanding candidate. Mouse lemurs are prosimian primates, roughly half the genetic distance between mice and humans. They are the smallest, fastest developing, and among the most prolific and abundant primates in the world, distributed throughout the island of Madagascar, many in separate breeding populations due to habitat destruction. Their physiology, behavior, and phylogeny have been studied for decades in laboratory colonies in Europe and in field studies in Malagasy rainforests, and a high quality reference genome sequence has recently been completed. To initiate a classical genetic approach, we developed a deep phenotyping protocol and have screened hundreds of laboratory and wild mouse lemurs for interesting phenotypes and begun mapping the underlying mutations, in collaboration with leading mouse lemur biologists. We also seek to establish a mouse lemur gene “knockout” library by sequencing the genomes of thousands of mouse lemurs to identify null alleles in most genes from the large pool of natural genetic variants. As part of this effort, we have begun a citizen science project in which students across Madagascar explore the remarkable biology around their schools, including longitudinal studies of the local mouse lemurs. We hope this work spawns a new model organism and cultivates a deep genetic understanding of primate biology and health. We also hope it establishes a new and ethical method of genetics that bridges biological, behavioral, medical, and conservation disciplines, while providing an example of how hands-on science education can help transform developing countries.",

    "abstract": "The uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC proteins of Escherichia coli were purified from strains that greatly overproduce these proteins. Using the purified proteins, the UVRABC nuclease was reconstituted in vitro. The reconstituted enzyme acted specifically on DNA damaged with UV, cis-platinum, and psoralen plus near UV. When UV-irradiated DNA was used as substrate, the enzyme made two cuts on the damaged DNA strand, one on each side of the damaged region. The enzyme hydrolyzed the eighth phosphodiester bond on the 5' side of pyrimidine dimers. On the 3' side of pyrimidine dimers, the UVRABC nuclease cut the fourth or the fifth phosphodiester bond 3' to pyrimidine dimers. The oligonucleotide with the damaged bases that is generated by these two cuts was released during treatment with the enzyme. We have also obtained evidence suggesting that the enzyme acts by the same mechanism on PydC photoproducts which are thought to be of primary importance in UV-induced mutagenesis.",
